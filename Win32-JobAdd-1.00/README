Win32-JobAdd version 1.00
=========================

A "job" is a collection of processes which can be controlled as a single unit. 
For example, you can reliably kill a process and all of its children by launching 
the process in a job, then telling Windows to kill all processes in the job.

There is another module Win32::Job which is fine when you don't need to do anything 
with the processes it spawns for you, but is limited otherwise.

With Win32::JobAdd you can create processes in a job environment and e.g. read 
the STDOUT from them.
